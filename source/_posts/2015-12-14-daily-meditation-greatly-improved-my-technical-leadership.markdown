A couple years ago, a coworker told me a success story about mindful meditation.
He explained how his wife took a class that required an hour of daily meditation
for a whole month. He reported that she found it uncomfortable, but the effects
were astounding. She claimed to feel more relaxed, more focused, and more
"herself". She found new reserves of motivation. She dropped the book she'd been
trying to write for years, and started a business. After that business failed,
she started another, this time successfully.

Immediately convinced, I started by listening to guided
[mindfulness meditations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness#Mindfulness_meditation)
on YouTube and [phone apps](https://www.headspace.com/science). After a couple
weeks of that, I started doing breathing exercises on my own while sitting
listening to rain sounds. I made a habit of doing it for about an hour every day
on my lunch break. A few months later, I hated it.

For whatever reason, after each session I would feel very uncomfortable. I would
be confronted with emotions that made me feel worthless and embarrassed. My mind
was bringing forward all these painful memories and feelings. Over time, I
started to dread the lunch break.

## The Revelation

Then, one day, I had a profound sense of understanding. I realized what was
causing these negative emotions. I was in the middle of a major push to guide
our team to adopt a new programming language. While I'd led many such
initiatives before, I saw that I'd always had the same struggles. My ego and
self-worth were so tied into "my" campaigns that I wasn't able to clearly hear
criticism. When people pointed out legitimate concerns or weaknesses, I would
get embarrassed and take it as a personal failure.

I could see, from the very beginning, my current "campaign" had been poorly
executed. After researching the new technology for a long time, I felt like I
saw a place where it could solve some of our needs. Instead of carefully writing
out a proposal, I "half-jokingly" brought it up whenever I could. When the
listeners didn't immediately react positively, I quickly retracted the idea,
"just kidding". Over weeks I dropped not-so-subtle hints, "this would be better
with...", or, "we wouldn't have this problem if...". Instead of convincing
anyone of anything, I just broadcasted to everyone how insecure I felt about the
issue. Everyone could clearly see that I cared, but I was too afraid to put
myself out there and make a serious suggestion. For months nothing changed, and
I felt more and more bitter that "my idea" wasn't being listened to. In reality,
I hadn't even made a serious suggestion yet!

Eventually, the people around me started to listen and research the new
language. They agreed it really did solve a need we had. After a while, enough
people got on board that we started using it more. Even then, I held tightly to
"my idea", afraid that it would prove to be a failure. When someone ran into
issues, I would get defensive. Even though I tried to keep my emotions in check,
I clearly took any criticism of the language as if it was a personal failing, no
matter how legitimate. I'd tightly coupled my ego to my ideas, and I always had.

After a few months of meditating, this idea rocked my world. My negative
emotions came from a realization that my actions were not in line with my
values. I don't want my self-worth to be tied to a simple tool. No tool is worth
it. Every tool fails. I'd sold myself short, lowered my self-worth to that of a
tool. This completely blocked my ability to be an effective technical leader.

I couldn't hear criticism of my ideas without getting defensive, so I couldn't
think critically. I couldn't help work out solutions to the best of my ability,
because that would mean admitting personal failure. Every side comment or
momentary struggle felt like a catastrophe.

After realizing this, I felt a wave of relief. My emotional struggle leading
this programming language change made sense! And I had an easy way out! I simply
had to distance myself from my ideas, separate my self-worth from my tools. The
more I meditated, the easier it got.

## Present Day

While I still sometimes get the old pang of embarrassment or defensiveness, now
I understand where it comes from, and how to move forward. I can let my ideas
go. I can consider ideas critically. I can make changes and adjustments if the
ideas are not working.

This summer I decided to write up my learning. I wanted to always be able to
look back and remember these important lessons. My write-up was the seed for the
book [Convincing Coworkers](https://leanpub.com/convincingcoworkers). I explain
the lessons learned from implementing a half dozen major technical changes, and
how I learned to lead without letting my ego cloud my thinking.

If you want to become a more effective leader, I highly recommend a practice of
daily meditation. Meditation gives your mind a chance to deeply consider your
actions and values. It allows your subconscious to reflect on what and why you
act.

Not every one will struggle from the same issues as me. Every leader has a
different set of challenges and situations. Meditation lets your mind analyze
your unique weaknesses and strengths, coming up with a tailored perspective.
Meditating allows your mind to creatively look for ways to improve itself. While
rarely comfortable, this process can have incredible benefits.

## "I'm uncomfortable with the idea of meditation"

You may feel uncomfortable with meditation because of its current strong
associations with Indian religions. On further research, I found that meditation
is something that has been taught and practiced by most major religions.
Buddhism, Catholicism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Taoism all
have strong meditation traditions. While some religions have stopped teaching
meditation in the last hundred years, it does not mean it is in any way wrong to
practice it. You will be reconnecting with traditions that were practiced by
your religion for hundreds of generations.

Additionally, meditation does not have to have a religious connotation. I
consider meditation like an exercise routine for the mind. If you are religious,
and exercise your body as a form of religious expression, then it is a religious
practice. If you are not, and exercise to improve your health and well-being, it
is not a religious practice. Simple as that. Meditation is a tool, and the tool
wielder determines its use.
