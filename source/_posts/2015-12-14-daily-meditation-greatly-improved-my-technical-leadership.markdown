A year ago, a coworker told me a success story about daily meditation. He
explained how his wife took a class that required an hour of daily meditation
for a whole month. He reported that while she found it uncomfortable, the
effects were astounding. She claimed to feel more relaxed, more focused, and
more "herself". She found new reserves of motivation. She dropped the book she'd
been trying to write for years, and started a business. After that business
failed, she started another.

I'd previously read about the [benefits](https://www.headspace.com/science) of
daily meditation. What sold me was the comment she passed on, "she was like a
whole different person, still herself, but better."
