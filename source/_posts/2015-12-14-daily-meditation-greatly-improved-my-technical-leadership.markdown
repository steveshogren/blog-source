A year ago, a coworker told me a success story about daily meditation. He
explained how his wife took a class that required an hour of daily meditation
for a whole month. He reported that while she found it uncomfortable, the
effects were astounding. She claimed to feel more relaxed, more focused, and
more "herself". She found new reserves of motivation. She dropped the book she'd
been trying to write for years, and started a business. After that business
failed, she started another, this time successfully.

I started by listening to a guided meditation on YouTube and phone apps. After a
couple days of that, I started just doing breathing exercises while sitting
listening to rain sounds. I made a habit of doing it for 50 minutes over my
lunch break. A few months later, I hated it.

For whatever reason, after each session I would feel very uncomfortable. I would
be confronted with emotions that made me feel worthless and embarrassed. My mind
was bringing forward all these painful memories and feelings. Over time, I
started to dread lunch time, even fear it.

At a certain point, I realized what was causing these emotions. I was in the
middle of a campaign to guide our office to use a new programming language, but
I'd been making a major mess of things. Instead of providing clarity, I'd been
making things worse. My ego was so tied into this campaign to switch that I
couldn't lead effectively.

My actions were not in line with values.
