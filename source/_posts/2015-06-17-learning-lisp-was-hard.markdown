title: "Learning Lisp Was Hard"

Several times in the last week people have lamented to me that they "just don't
get lisp". After hearing it for the third time, I thought back to my experience
learning a Lisp.

When I set out to learn a Lisp, I expected it would be easy.

I figured, "I am pretty awesome at PHP, and have worked professionally in Perl,
Python, and Java, this should be a cakewalk!". I'd read Paul Graham's essays on
how Lisp is his secret weapon, and figured I needed to get into this secret
weapon stuff. "Since Paul is amazing, and I am too, I'll be a natural!"

I expected to tinker around with Lisp (I didn't know there was more
than one) and shortly master it to be able to ship a website with it.

What happened instead took me a little longer than that.

## Timeline

* 05/11 - 06/11 - Working through half of Land Of Lisp (gave up)
* 04/12 - 08/12 - Rewrote a PHP project in Clojure
* 08/12 - 09/12 - Read "Clojure Programming" twice
* 09/12 - 12/12 - Took CS173 Programming Languages online at Brown University
* 05/13 - 07/13 - Worked through Let Over Lambda
* 05/13 - 12/14 - Worked through SICP
* 07/14 - Introduced at work and shipped production Clojure code
* 12/14 - Present - Built and deployed Clojure-based side project

I think Lisps started to "click" for me around mid 2013, about two years after
deciding that I'd "tinker around" for a bit before "mastering" it. I'd put in
roughly an hour a day from Aug '12
