Right now I manage a team of self organizing software developers.

### Individual Expectations

Each individual is expected to work a strict 40 hour week. You should
confidently leave at eight hours sharp. Overtime in this office is not
considered a virtue, as the well researched costs end up losing our business
time and money long term. Overtime for the sake of "signaling to management" is
disapproved and not rewarded. You are expected to come in and work as hard as
you can such that you are "done" at the end of an eight hour day and could
perform no additional effort. In the rare circumstances that overtime is
required, it will be clearly stated and have clearly defined goals: e.g. solving
a critical and time-sensitive customer issue. Your manager should know and
approve of the overtime. In these circumstances it is expected that you will
come in later to make up for it unless otherwise stated.

In all circumstances, you are expected to be responsible for the development
team and code base. If someone is late consistently, has poor hygiene, or is not
performing their duties sufficiently, you are expected to bring it up to them
privately. If they continue, bring it up in a retrospective or let their manager
know. If you see someone doing anything illegal or performing harassment,
immediately let their manager know. Common sense should dictate when it is a
"business issue" or a "legality issue".

Each developer shares the responsibility of the quality of the entire code base
of the office. Since teams move and reform fluidly, you might be maintaining a
new code base at any time. Behaving as a good citizen of this office means
always doing everything possible to have your code ready to hand off at a
moments notice. Long branches, commented out code, failing tests, and broken
builds all should be dealt with immediately as the highest priority. Refactoring
projects should be completed by the individual who "champions" it. Undertaking a
multi-session refactoring is acceptable, but should have clearly stated goals
and end state.

The individual is expected to mentor every other developer in all areas
technical, social, and collaborative. No one is exempt from the duty of gently
correcting another who is incorrect. Everyone is expected to take correction or
suggestions seriously, regardless of their source. If the most junior developer
corrects the most senior, the most senior is expected to listen and take it as
seriously as possible.

You are expected to behave in a manner fitting for a professional. Profanity,
coarse joking, or sexual innuendo are commonly considered to be inappropriate
behavior for an American professional, and as such should not be tolerated. The
individual is expected to call out their teammates for such behavior with a firm
comment immediately, e.g. "that is inappropriate".

Retrospectives are mandatory, as they are the primary way for the team to
improve and communicate issues. If you do not approve of the format or the
frequency, bring it up and convince everyone to make a change.

Team structure and working agreements are decided on by the team, with the whole
development staff providing insight. No new team may form without the consent of
the development staff at large. The team's working agreements must adhere to the
goals of information sharing, training, high code quality, low defect rates,
automated regression, and regular automated builds and deployment. Pair
programming is not mandatory by a team, but can be replaced with alternate
working agreements that are approved by the larger technical staff.
