Self organizing teams are a complex topic. I believe they have very clear pros
and cons. At my work, I manage a self organizing team which has a unique set of
expectations.

### Individual Expectations

Each individual is expected to work a strict 40 hour week. You should
confidently leave at eight hours sharp. Overtime in our office is not considered
a virtue. The negative side-effects over the long term lose our business time
and money. Overtime for the sake of "signaling to management" is not rewarded.
You are expected to come in and work as hard as you can such that you are "done"
at the end of an eight hour day and could perform no additional effort. In the
rare event that overtime is required, it will be clearly stated and have clearly
defined goals: e.g. solving a critical and time-sensitive customer issue. Your
manager should know and approve of the overtime. In these circumstances it is
expected that you will come in later the next day to make up for it.

Each individual expected to be responsible for the quality and productivity of
the development team. If someone is late consistently, has poor hygiene, or is
not performing their duties sufficiently, you are expected to bring it up to
them privately. If they continue, bring it up in a retrospective or let their
manager know. If you see someone doing anything illegal or performing
harassment, immediately let their manager know. Common sense should dictate when
it is a "business issue" or a "legality issue".

Each developer shares the responsibility for the quality of the entire code base
of the office. Since teams move and reform fluidly, you might be maintaining a
new code base at any given time. Behaving as a good citizen of this office means
always doing everything possible to have your code ready to hand off at a
moments notice. Long branches, commented out code, failing tests, and broken
builds all should be dealt with as the highest priority. Refactoring projects
should be completed by the individual or group who "champions" it. Undertaking a
multi-session refactoring is acceptable, but should have clear end goals.

The individual is expected to mentor every other developer in all areas
technical, social, and collaborative. No one is exempt from the duty of gently
correcting another. Everyone is expected to take correction or suggestions
seriously, regardless of their source. If the most junior developer corrects the
most senior, the most senior is expected to treat it seriously.

You are expected to behave in a manner fitting for a professional. Profanity,
coarse joking, or sexual innuendo are commonly considered to be inappropriate
behavior for an American professional. The individual is expected to call out
their teammates for such behavior with a firm comment immediately, e.g. "that is
inappropriate for a professional."

The more experienced the developer, the more they are expected to demonstrate
these tenants. A less experienced developer is afforded more obstinance and
single-mindedness, but the most experienced are expected to weigh every option
and lead by example in every way.

Leadership is driven through consensus. If a developer wishes to make a change,
they must build consensus with the team and get a majority vote. If a majority
vote cannot be made, the onus is on the individual to modify their suggestion to
make it more acceptable or drop the suggestion.

### Development Team Expectations

The most powerful tool we have are retrosepectives. Retrospectives are
mandatory, as they are the primary way for the team to improve and communicate
issues. If you do not approve of the format or the frequency, convince the team
to make a change.

Team formation and working agreements are decided on by the team, with the whole
development staff providing insight. No new team may form without the consent of
the development staff at large. All teams must have working agreements that
adhere to the goals of: information sharing, rapid training, high code quality,
low defect rates, automated regression, and regular automated builds and
deployment.

The "default" method for every team should be pair programming and TDD. These
are not mandatory, but can be replaced with alternate working agreements if
approved by the larger technical staff. Any deviations from the default should
be documented and reviewed regularly.

### Development Manager Expectations

Primarily, the development manager is charged with ensuring a culture that
attracts and enriches high quality talent. This can be accomplished though team
empowerment, regular mentoring, and conflict resolution. Their goal is to build
a team of individuals and trust them to perform with excellence.

The manager should be consistently watching for cultural dividers who cause the
teams to excessively fight or grow negative. These dividers should be given
feedback with the goal of improvement or "managing out". Dividers often cause a
toxic culture to form, which destroys morale.

Development managers are the last stop when the team is unable to correct the
behavior of an individual. They are to freely allow teams to reorganize and
develop working agreements as long as they are in line with meeting the needs of
the business.

The development manager holds no technical authority over the development staff,
nor handles prioritization and assignment of work. The work priorities are to be
handled by the business experts. Work is assigned to the development team, which
is expected to organize around those proirities.

Additionally development managers interact with recruiters and coordinate HR
related functions and documentation. All work that infringes on the the time of
the development staff should be handled by the development manager. Timesheets,
vacation tracking, interaction with recruiters, and project managment should be
kept from the development staff.
