I used to hate type systems. As a junior programmer, I did most of my
work in Perl and PHP, so working in C#/Java always felt so
overwrought. In Java especially, one has to write out the type of the
varible almost every time you use it, which explodes the amount of
busywork the developer must do.

Unit tests are a poor man's type system.

There, I said it. You know why I think this? Becuase I just took (am
taking?) over a legacy codebase. You know what makes that way easier?
Typing.
